                <h2>Quem somos</h2>
                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
                The point of using <strong>lorem Ipsum </strong> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
                making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use <strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong> as their default model text, 
                and a search for '<strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong>' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
                sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

                <p>There are many variations of passages of <strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong> available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, 
                by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of <strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong>, 
                you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the <strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong> generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, 
                making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate <strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong> which looks reasonable. 
                The generated <strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong> is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
